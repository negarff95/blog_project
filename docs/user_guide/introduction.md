# Blog Rating System Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for our simple blog rating system! Our blog allows users to rate posts, providing valuable feedback and helping readers identify the most insightful content. In this documentation, we'll explore how our rating system works and how we ensure the integrity and fairness of user-generated ratings.

## Introduction

Our blog aims to provide a platform to share posts while fostering a community of engaged readers. One of the key features of our blog is the ability for users to rate posts based on their quality and relevance. These ratings assist readers in discovering the most valuable posts.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Before users can rate a post, they are required to authenticate, ensuring that ratings are tied to individual user accounts and preventing abuse.
- **Rate Weighting System**: We implement a sophisticated rate weighting system that assigns weights to ratings based on various factors such as user activity, account age, and rate quality. This ensures that ratings from more credible users carry more weight.
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent spam and manipulation, we enforce rate limiting on a per-user basis, allowing only a specific number of ratings within a given time frame.
- **Outlier Detection**: We employ statistical methods, including standard deviation analysis, to identify and down-weight outlier rates that could skew the average post rating.
- **Average Rating Speed**: Monitoring the average rating speed helps us detect unusual rating patterns and adjust the weight of ratings accordingly.
